# This is similar to pyproject.toml [build-system.requires], but not exactly as
# the present file is used to create environment for the editable install.
# For the editable install, the build-time and runtime numpy version will be
# the same, so the constraints are slightly different than in [build-system.requires].

# This could be moved into the [dependency-group] of pyproject.toml when
# - pip supports dependency-group https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12963
# - uv supports meson-python editable installs https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/10214
