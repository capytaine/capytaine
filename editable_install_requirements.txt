# This is similar to pyproject.toml [build-system.requires], but not exactly as
# the present file is used to create environment for the editable install.
# For the editable install, the build-time and runtime numpy version will be
# the same, so the constraints are slightly different than in [build-system.requires].
# This could be moved into pyproject.toml when/if
# https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11440 is implemented, because at the moment
# pip tries to build the package before installing extra dependencies.
