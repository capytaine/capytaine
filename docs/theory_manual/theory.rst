Linear boundary value problem
=============================

Hypotheses
----------

1. The fluid is inviscid.
2. The fluid is incompressible: :math:`\nabla \cdot u = 0` with :math:`u` the flow velocity. 
3. The flow is irrotational: :math:`\nabla \times u = 0`.
4. The wave amplitude is small with respect to the wavelength.
5. The amplitude of the body motion is small with respect to its dimension.
6. The sea bottom is flat. The water depth is denoted :math:`h`.

Mathematical problem
--------------------

The mass conservation equation can be rewritten as the Laplace equation

.. math::
   \nabla^2 \phi = 0,
   :label: laplace

where :math:`\phi` is the velocity potential defined as :math:`u = \nabla \phi`.

Since the problem is linear, we look for a solution in the frequency domain:

.. math::
   \phi = \mathrm{Re} \left( \Phi e^{-i \omega t} \right).


The partial differential equation :eq:`laplace` is completed with the following boundary conditions:

* linearized free surface boundary condition:

.. math::
   g \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial z} - \omega^2 \Phi = 0, \qquad \text{on } z = 0.
   :label: bc_fs

* no velocity boundary condition at the (flat) sea bottom:

.. math::
   \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial z} = 0, \qquad \text{on } z = -h.
   :label: bc_bottom

* a given velocity :math:`u` on the floating body surface :math:`\Gamma`:

.. math::
   \nabla \Phi \cdot n = u \cdot n, \qquad \text{on } \Gamma,
   :label: bc_body

where :math:`n` denotes the normal vector at the surface of the floating body.

.. * in the far field, 
   .. math::
      \sqrt{R} \left( \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial R} - i m_0 \right) \left( \Phi - Phi_0 \right)
      \rightarrow 0, \qquad \text{when } R \rightarrow \infty,

The normal velocity on the floating body surface is the input of the problem.
It depends on the type of problem:

**Radiation problem**:
    For the radiation problem, the normal velocity on the body surface corresponds to the motion of the body along one of its degrees of freedom.
    The resolution of the Laplace problem allows to derive the added mass and the radiation damping associated with this degree of freedom (see also Post-processing_).

**Diffraction problem**:
    For the diffraction problem, the velocity on the floating body is given by the velocity of Airy's wave field.
    Once the problem has been solved, the linear Froude-Krylov force is computed by the integration of the pressure (:math:`p = i \rho \omega \Phi`) on the floating body (see also Post-processing_).

    The incoming Airy's wave fields is given by

    .. math::
       \Phi_0 = - i \frac{g}{\omega} \frac{\cosh (m_0 (z+h))}{\cosh (m_0 h)} e^{i m_0 (x \cos \beta + y \sin \beta)}

    in finite depth, where the wave number :math:`m_0` is defined by the dispersion relation :math:`\omega^2 = m_0 g \tanh (m_0 h)`, and by

    .. math::
       \Phi_0 = - i \frac{g}{\omega} e^{k z} e^{i k (x \cos \beta + y \sin \beta)}

    in infinite depth, where the wave number :math:`k` is defined by :math:`\omega^2 = k g`.

    In the above equations, :math:`\beta` is the angle of the incoming wave.
    The angle :math:`\beta = 0` corresponds to waves propagating in the :math:`x` direction from :math:`x=-\infty` to :math:`x=+\infty`.
    The angle :math:`\beta = \pi/2` corresponds to waves propagating in the :math:`y` direction from :math:`y=-\infty` to :math:`y=+\infty`.


Integral problem
----------------

The partial differential equation can be rewritten as a boundary integral problem.
Let us introduce the Green function :math:`G(\xi, \cdot)`, which is solution of the partial differential equation:

.. math::
   \nabla^2_x G(\xi, x) = \delta(\xi - x), \qquad \forall x,

associated with the boundary condition :eq:`bc_fs` and :eq:`bc_bottom`, where :math:`\xi` is a given point in the domain and :math:`\delta` is the Dirac distribution.

With the help of this Green function :math:`G`, the potential of the surface of the floating body :math:`\Gamma` can be rewritten as a function of a source distribution :math:`\sigma`:

.. math::
   \Phi(x) = \iint_\Gamma \sigma(y) G(x, y) \, \mathrm{dS}(y).
   :label: continuous_source_formulation

.. note:: There is a typo in this equation in [BD15]_.

The integral on the other boundaries of the domain is zero due to the properties of the Green function.

The differentiation of :eq:`continuous_source_formulation` leads to the following equation [Del87]_:

.. math::
   (u \cdot n)(x) = \frac{\sigma(x)}{2} + \iint_\Gamma \sigma(y) \, (\nabla_x G(x, y) \cdot n) \, \mathrm{dS}(y).
   :label: diff_continuous_source_formulation

where :math:`n` is the normal vector on the floating body surface :math:`\Gamma`.

.. note:: Dimensional analysis:

    :math:`\Phi` is in m²·s¯¹.

    :math:`\sigma` is in m·s¯¹.

    :math:`G` is in m¯¹.

Expression of the Green function
================================

In infinite depth
-----------------

The integral problem above relates the potential :math:`\Phi` to the normal velocity
:math:`u \cdot n` via the Green function :math:`G`. Let us know discuss the evaluation of this
function for an infinite water depth.
See also [X18]_.

Green function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Green function can be written as the sum of three terms:

.. math::
   G(\xi, x) = - \frac{1}{4 \pi} \left( G_0(\xi, x) + G_1(\xi, x) + G_2(\xi, x) \right)
   :label: green_function

The first term

.. math::
    G_0(\xi, x) = \frac{1}{\|x - \xi\|}
    :label: green_function_inf_depth_0

is the usual Green function for the 3D Laplace equation without our specific boundary conditions.

The second part reads

.. math::
    G_1(\xi, x) = - \frac{1}{\|x - s(\xi)\|} 
    :label: green_function_inf_depth_1

where :math:`s(\xi_1, \xi_2, \xi_3) = (\xi_1, \xi_2, -\xi_3)` is the reflection of :math:`\xi` across the free surface.

Finally, this last part is complex-valued and it is introduced to satisfy the boundary conditions :eq:`bc_fs`.
It depends on the water depth :math:`h` and the wave frequency :math:`\omega` (through the wave number :math:`k`).

.. math::
    G_2(\xi, x) & = 
    \frac{2 k}{\pi} \Re \left( \int^{\pi/2}_{-\pi/2} \left( J(\zeta(\theta)) - \frac{1}{\zeta(\theta)} \right) \, \mathrm{d} \theta \right) \\
    & \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad + 2 i k \Re \left( \int^{\pi/2}_{-\pi/2} e^{\zeta (\theta)} \, \mathrm{d} \theta \right)
    :label: green_function_inf_depth_2

where

.. math::
    J(\zeta) = 
    \begin{cases}
    e^\zeta \left[ E_1(\zeta) + i\pi \right] \quad \text{if} ~ \Im(\zeta) \ge 0 \\
    e^\zeta \left[ E_1(\zeta) - i\pi \right] \quad \text{if} ~ \Im(\zeta) < 0
    \end{cases}

where :math:`E_1` is the first exponential integral, defined as

.. math::
    E_1(z) = \int_z^\infty \frac{e^{-t}}{t} dt,

and

.. math::
    \zeta (\theta) = k \left( x_3 + \xi_3 + i r \cos \theta \right)
    :label: def_zeta

where

.. math::
    r = \sqrt{(\xi_1 - x_1)^2 + (\xi_2 - x_2)^2}.
    :label: def_r


.. proof:property::

   The function :math:`G` is symmetric in the sense of 

   .. math::
   
        \forall x, \xi, \quad G(x, \xi) = G(\xi, x).

Variants of the formulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _integrate_one_over_zeta:

.. proof:lemma::

    The following identity holds [Del89]_:

    .. math::
       \Re \int^{\pi/2}_{-\pi/2} \frac{1}{\zeta(\theta)} \, \mathrm{d} \theta = - \frac{\pi}{k \|x - s(\xi)\|}.
       :label: int_1_over_zeta

    It can be used to derived an alternative expression for the first term of :eq:`green_function_inf_depth_2`.

.. proof:lemma::

    For any function :math:`f`, the following two formulations of the integral are equivalent:

    .. math::
        \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} f \left(\zeta(\theta) \right) \mathrm{d} \theta = 
        \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} f \left(\tilde{\zeta}(\theta) \right) \mathrm{d} \theta

    where :math:`\zeta` is defined in :eq:`def_zeta` and :math:`\tilde{\zeta}` is defined as

    .. math::
       \tilde{\zeta} (\theta) = k \left( x_3 + \xi_3 + i \left( (x_1 - \xi_1) \cos\theta + (x_2 - \xi_2) \sin\theta \right) \right).

.. proof:proof::

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      (x_1 - \xi_1) \cos(\theta) + (x_2 - \xi_2) \sin(\theta) & = \Re \left( \left( x_1 - \xi_1  + i (x_2 - \xi_2) \right) e^{-i \theta} \right) \\
                   & = \Re \left( r e^{i (\alpha - \theta)} \right) \\
                   & = r \cos \left( \alpha - \theta \right) \\
      \end{align*}

   where :math:`r` and :math:`\alpha` are defined by

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \[
          r e^{i \alpha} = (x_1 - \xi_1)  + i (x_2 - \xi_2).
      \]

   Finally note that:

    .. math::
        :nowrap:

        \[
            \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha}^{\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha} f \left(\zeta(\theta) \right) \mathrm{d} \theta = 
            \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} f \left(\zeta(\theta) \right) \mathrm{d} \theta
        \]


Gradient of the Green function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The gradient of the Green function can be written as

.. math::
   \nabla_x G(\xi, x) = - \frac{1}{4 \pi} \left( \nabla_x G_0(\xi, x) + \nabla_x G_1(\xi, x) + \nabla_x G_2(\xi, x) \right)

where

.. math::
    \nabla_x G_0(\xi, x) = - \frac{x - \xi}{\|x - \xi\|^3}\,,
    :label: green_function_inf_depth_deriv_0

.. math::
    \nabla_x G_1(\xi, x) = \frac{x - s(\xi)}{\|x - s(\xi)\|^3}\,,
    :label: green_function_inf_depth_deriv_1

and 

.. math::
    \nabla_x G_2(\xi, x) = &
    \frac{2 k}{\pi} \Re \left( \int^{\pi/2}_{-\pi/2} \left( J(\zeta(\theta)) - \frac{1}{\zeta(\theta)} \right) \, (\nabla_x \zeta) (\theta) \, \mathrm{d} \theta \right) \\
    & - 2 \frac{x - s(\xi)}{\|x - s(\xi)\|^3} 
    + 2 i k \Re \left( \int^{\pi/2}_{-\pi/2} e^{\zeta (\theta)} \, (\nabla_x \zeta) (\theta) \, \mathrm{d} \theta \right) \\
    :label: green_function_inf_depth_deriv_2

where

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \[
   (\nabla_x \zeta) (\theta) = k
   \begin{pmatrix}
   \frac{x_1 - \xi_1}{r} i \cos \theta \\
   \frac{x_2 - \xi_2}{r} i \cos \theta \\
   1
   \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

.. proof:proof::

    The derivation of :eq:`green_function_inf_depth_deriv_0` and :eq:`green_function_inf_depth_deriv_1` is straightforward.

    Let us discuss the derivation of :eq:`green_function_inf_depth_deriv_2`. Using :numref:`Lemma {number} <integrate_one_over_zeta>`, the Green function :eq:`green_function_inf_depth_2` can be rewritten as:

    .. math::
        G_2(\xi, x) & = 
        \frac{2 k}{\pi} \Re \left( \int^{\pi/2}_{-\pi/2} J(\zeta(\theta)) \, \mathrm{d} \theta \right) + \frac{2}{\|x - s(\xi)\|} \\
        & \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad + 2 i k \Re \left( \int^{\pi/2}_{-\pi/2} e^{\zeta (\theta)} \, \mathrm{d} \theta \right)


    Using the identity :math:`J'(\zeta) = J(\zeta) - 1/\zeta`, the first term of :eq:`green_function_inf_depth_deriv_2` can be derived.

    .. math::
        \nabla_x \left( \int^{\pi/2}_{-\pi/2} J(\zeta(\theta)) \, \mathrm{d} \theta \right) = \int^{\pi/2}_{-\pi/2} \left( J(\zeta(\theta)) - \frac{1}{\zeta(\theta)} \right) \, (\nabla_x \zeta) (\theta) \, \mathrm{d} \theta

    The second term of :eq:`green_function_inf_depth_deriv_2` is similar to :eq:`green_function_inf_depth_deriv_1`.
    Finally, the last term can be found as follows:

    .. math::
        \nabla_x \left( \int^{\pi/2}_{-\pi/2} e^{\zeta(\theta)} \, \mathrm{d} \theta \right) = \int^{\pi/2}_{-\pi/2} e^{\zeta(\theta)} \, (\nabla_x \zeta) (\theta) \, \mathrm{d} \theta

.. note:: There is a typo in the second term of :eq:`green_function_inf_depth_deriv_2` in [Del89]_ and [BD15]_. It appears to be missing from [X18]_.

.. note::
    The derivative of :math:`G` with respect to :math:`x_1` and :math:`x_2` are antisymmetric in the sense of 

    .. math::
       :nowrap:

        \[
        \frac{\partial G}{\partial x_1} (\xi, x) = - \frac{\partial G}{\partial x_1}(x, \xi).
        \]

    Its derivative with respect to :math:`x_3` can be decomposed into an antisymmetric term and a symmetric term.

Symmetries
----------

The first term of :eq:`green_function` is invariant under all rotations and translations, whereas the second term is invariant under isometric transformations that don't change the vertical coordinate (reflection across a vertical plane, rotation around a vertical axis, translation following an horizontal vector).


Discretization
==============

The equations :eq:`continuous_source_formulation` and :eq:`diff_continuous_source_formulation` can be discretized using a collocation method.
Considering a mesh of the surface of the floating body :math:`\Gamma = \cup_i \Gamma_i`:

.. math::
   \Phi_i   & = \Phi(x_i), \\
   \sigma_i & = \sigma(x_i), \\
   u_i      & = (u \cdot n)(x_i) \\
   S_{ij}   & = \iint_{\Gamma_j} G(x_i, y) \mathrm{dS}(y), \\
   V_{ij}   & = \iint_{\Gamma_j} \nabla_{x_i} G(x_i, y) \cdot n \, \mathrm{dS}(y),

where for all :math:`i`, :math:`x_i` is the center of the face :math:`\Gamma_i`.
Each element of the matrices :math:`S` and :math:`V` can be seen as the interaction between two faces of the mesh.

The matrices :math:`S` and :math:`V` relates the vectors :math:`\Phi`, :math:`u` and :math:`\sigma` through the following approximations of :eq:`continuous_source_formulation` and :eq:`diff_continuous_source_formulation`:

.. math::
   \Phi = S \sigma, \qquad u = \left( \frac{\mathbb{I}}{2} + V \right) \sigma.
   :label: discrete_BEM_problem

The resolution of the discrete problem with Nemoh consists of two main steps:

1. The evaluation of the coefficients of the complex-valued matrices :math:`S` and :math:`V`
2. The resolution of the complex-valued linear problem :math:`\left( \frac{\mathbb{I}}{2} + V \right) \sigma = u`.

Once :math:`\sigma` has been computed, :math:`\Phi` can be easily deduced.
Then other magnitudes such as the Froude-Krylov forces or the added mass can be derived.

Post-processing
===============

Forces on body surfaces
-----------------------

Forces acting on body surfaces are computed by integration of the pressure field. They can be decomposed into three contributions:

1. The Froude-Krylov forces :math:`F_{FK, i}`, from the integration of the incident wave field pressure (incoming plane waves); :math:`i` denotes the i-th degree of freedom
2. The diffraction forces :math:`F_{D, i}`, from the integration of the diffracted wave field (all bodies held fixed)
3. The radiation forces :math:`F_{R, ij}`, from the result of the radiation problem with radiating degree of freedom :math:`j` and influenced degree of freedom :math:`i`

Dynamic coupling and impedance
------------------------------
Consider a body or a system of bodies. The general linear equation of motion can be expressed in time domain as 

.. math:: M_{ij} \ddot{x}_j + C_{ij} \dot{x}_j + K_{ij} x_j = F_i,

and in frequency domain, with the assumed time dependence :math:`x(t) = \mathrm{Re} \left( X e^{-j \omega t} \right)`,

.. math:: \left[-\omega^2M_{ij} - j \omega C_{ij} + K_{ij}\right] X_j = F_i,

where :math:`M_{ij}` is the inertia matrix, accounting for the mass distribution, :math:`C_{ij}` is the mechanical damping matrix, :math:`K_{ij}` is the stiffness matrix which comprises mechanical and hydrostatic effects, and :math:`F_i` are generic external forces.

.. note:: The hydrostatic contribution to matrix :math:`K_{ij}` accounts for a variation of hydrostatic force in direction :math:`i` due to a unit motion in direction :math:`j`. It is a geometric property of the body.

Forces :math:`F_i` can be decomposed as

.. math:: F_i = F_{FK, i} + F_{D, i} + F_{R, ij}

and :math:`F_{R, ij}` can be further rewritten as 

.. math:: F_{R, ij} = \left[\omega^2 A_{ij} + j\omega B_{ij}\right] X_j

where :math:`A_{ij}` is the added mass matrix and :math:`B_{ij}` is the radiation damping matrix; these properties are thus obtained from the real and imaginary parts of the radiation force. The full system becomes

.. math:: \left[-\omega^2 (M_{ij} + A_{ij}) - j \omega (C_{ij} + B_{ij}) + K_{ij}\right] X_j = F_i

and the oscillation amplitude is obtained by solving the system.

.. note:: Matrices :math:`A_{ij}` and :math:`B_{ij}` depend on :math:`\omega`, and so does :math:`X_j`.

Free surface elevation
----------------------

The potential at the reference surface :math:`z = 0` can be connected to the free surface elevation by the dynamic condition

.. math:: \dfrac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = - g \eta

which, in frequency domain, is

.. math:: \eta = \dfrac{j \omega}{g} \Phi

For a fully coupled problem (bodies free to oscillate, i.e. diffraction and radiation combined), the free surface elevation can be computed as 

.. math:: \eta = \eta_{\text{incident}} + \eta_{\text{diffracted}} -j \omega \sum_i \eta_{\text{radiated}, i}   X_i

where factor :math:`-j \omega` transforms :math:`\eta_{\text{radiated}, i}` from the radiated wave field corresponding to unit oscillation velocity to the field corresponding to unit oscillation amplitude.
