Building a dataset from LinearPotentialFlowResult
-------------------------------------------------

If you have a list of :code:`LinearPotentialFlowResult`, you can assemble
them in a xarray dataset for a more convenient post-processing. Use the
following syntax::

   from capytaine import assemble_dataset
   dataset = assemble_dataset(list_of_results)

If you gave a test matrix to the :code:`BEMSolver.fill_dataset` method, the
output will directly be an xarray dataset.

Both :code:`assemble_dataset` and :code:`fill_dataset` accept some optional keyword
arguments to store more information in the dataset:

- :code:`wavenumber` (default: :code:`False`): add the wavenumber of the
  incoming waves in the dataset.
- :code:`wavelength` (default: :code:`False`): add the wavelength of the
  incoming waves in the dataset.
- :code:`mesh` (default: :code:`False`): add some information about the mesh in
  the dataset (number of faces, quadrature method).
- :code:`hydrostatics` (default: :code:`True`): if hydrostatics data are
  available in the :code:`FloatingBody`, they are added to the dataset. 

.. note:: The code does its best to keep the degrees of freedom in the same
          order as they have been provided by the user, but there is no
          guarantee that this will always be the case.
          Nonetheless, in all cases the labels will always match the data.
          So selecting a value by the name of the dof will always return the right one::

              data.sel(radiating_dof="Heave", influenced_dof="Heave")

          You can also manually reorder the dofs with the following syntax::

              sorted_dofs = ["Surge", "Sway", "Heave", "Roll", "Pitch", "Yaw"]
              print(data.sel(radiating_dof=sorted_dofs, influenced_dof=sorted_dofs))

.. note:: Datasets created with :code:`assemble_dataset` only include data on
          cases with a free surface.
          Cases without a free surface (:code:`free_surface=infty`) are ignored.

Building a dataset from Bemio
-----------------------------

An xarray dataset can also be created from data structures generated using the `Bemio
<https://wec-sim.github.io/bemio/>`_ package, which reads hydrodynamic output data
from NEMOH, WAMIT, and AQWA. This allows for Capytaine post-processing of hydrodynamic
data generated from other BEM codes.

Bemio does not come packaged with Capytaine and needs to to be installed independently.
Note that `the base repository of Bemio <https://github.com/WEC-Sim/bemio/>`_ has been
archived and is only compatible with Python 2.7.x, so using a Python 3 compatible fork is
recommended, available `here <https://github.com/michaelcdevin/bemio>`_ or installed with::

  pip install git+https://github.com/michaelcdevin/bemio.git

To build the xarray dataset using Capytaine, the output files from the BEM program in
question must be read into a Bemio :code:`data_structures.ben.HydrodynamicData` class, which is
then called by `assemble_dataset`. For example, to create an xarray dataset from a WAMIT
:code:`.out` file::

  from bemio.io.wamit import read as read_wamit
  import capytaine as cpt
  bemio_data = read_wamit("myfile.out")
  my_dataset = cpt.assemble_dataset(bemio_data, hydrostatics=False)

.. warning:: The created dataset will only contain quantities that can be directly calculated
             from the values given in the original dataset. Because of this, there may be minor
             differences between the variable names in an xarray dataset build with Bemio and one created
             using :code:`LinearPotentialFlowResult`, even though the format will be identical. For
             example, WAMIT :code:`.out` files do not contain the radii of gyration needed to calculate
             the moments of inertia, so the `my_dataset['inertia_matrix']` variable would not be included 
             in the above example since the rigid body mass matrix cannot be calculated.

Saving the dataset as NetCDF file
---------------------------------

The xarray dataset produced by :func:`assemble_dataset <capytaine.results.assemble_dataset>` (or :meth:`fill_dataset <capytaine.bem.solver.BEMSolver.fill_dataset>`) has a structure close to the NetCDF file format and can easily be saved to this format::

	dataset.to_netcdf("path/to/dataset.nc")

See the `documentation of xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/io.html>`_ for details and options.

There are however a couple of issues you should be aware of:


Complex numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The netCDF standard does not handle complex numbers.
As a workaround, the complex-valued array can be saved as a bigger real-valued array with the help of the :mod:`capytaine.io.xarray` module::

    from capytaine.io.xarray import separate_complex_values
    separate_complex_values(dataset).to_netcdf("path/to/dataset.nc")

The dataset can then be reloaded by::

    from capytaine.io.xarray import merge_complex_values
    dataset = merge_complex_values(xr.open_dataset("path/to/dataset.nc"))


String format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is an issue with the handling of strings in xarray.
It affects the coordinates with strings as labels such as :code:`radiating_dof` and :code:`influenced_dof`.
They can be stored in xarray either as NetCDF string objects, which can be written in a NetCDF file, or as Python strings stored as generic Python objects, which cannot be written in a NetCDF file.
The issue is that the xarray library sometimes changes from one to the other without warnings.
It leads to the error :code:`ValueError: unsupported dtype for netCDF4 variable: object` when trying to export a dataset.

This can be fixed by explicitly converting the strings to the right format when exporting the dataset::

    dataset.to_netcdf("dataset.nc",
                      encoding={'radiating_dof': {'dtype': 'U'},
                                'influenced_dof': {'dtype': 'U'}})

See also `this Github issue <https://github.com/capytaine/capytaine/issues/2>`_.

Exporting to Excel
------------------

The example below uses the ``openpyxl`` library (that can be installed with ``pip install openpyxl``) to export a dataset to Excel format::

    dataset[["added_mass", "radiation_damping"]].to_dataframe().to_excel("radiation_data.xlsx")

    from capytaine.io.xarray import separate_complex_values
    separate_complex_values(dataset[["Froude_Krylov_force", "diffraction_force"]]).to_dataframe().to_excel("diffraction_data.xlsx")

For convienence, the radiation and diffraction data have been stored in separate files.
Since this export method poorly supports complex number, the func:`~capytaine.io.xarray.separate_complex_values` has been used to transform them to a pair of real numbers, as discussed for NetCDF export above.


Saving the hydrostatics data
----------------------------

In order to save the following hydrostatics information:

- Hydrostatic stiffness matrix,
- Centre of gravity,
- Centre of buoyancy,
- Displacement volume

There are two files that can be written using the :mod:`capytaine.io.legacy` module::

    from capytaine.io.legacy import export_hydrostatics
    export_hydrostatics("directory_to_save_hydrostatics_data", bodies)

Where :code:`bodies` can be a single :code:`FloatingBody` object or a list of :code:`FloatingBody` objects.

:func:`export_hydrostatics <capytaine.io.legacy.export_hydrostatics>` writes the :code:`Hydrostatics.dat` and :code:`KH.dat` files in the original Nemoh format. These :code:`.dat` files can be used by BEMIO to produce :code:`.h5` files for WEC-Sim.

In order to use this function, please ensure that the body's centre of gravity has been defined correctly and the following methods have been called on the :code:`FloatingBody` object before passing it to :func:`export_hydrostatics <capytaine.io.legacy.export_hydrostatics>`::

  body.add_all_rigid_body_dofs()
  body.compute_rigid_body_inertia()
  body.compute_hydrostatics()


Saving the data as legacy Tecplot files
---------------------------------------

.. warning:: This feature is experimental.

The following code will write files named :code:`RadiationCoefficients.tec` and :code:`ExcitationForce.tec` in a format matching the one of Nemoh 2.0::

	from capytaine.io.legacy import write_dataset_as_tecplot_files
	write_dataset_as_tecplot_files("path/to/directory", dataset)
