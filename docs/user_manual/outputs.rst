Outputs stored in LinearPotentialFlowResult
-------------------------------------------

Each ``LinearPotentialFlowResult`` object contains all the data defined for the
corresponding problem::

  problem = cpt.DiffractionProblem(body=body, period=1.0, wave_direction=3.14)
  solver = cpt.BEMSolver()
  result = solver.solve(problem, keep_details=True)

  print(result.period)
  # 1.0

They also contain a supplementary attribute named ``forces``, containing the
computed forces on the body::

  print(result.forces)
  # {'Surge': (23941.728129534735+9487.048661471363j), 'Sway': (-2.010438038269058e-09-2.8862814360763878e-09j), ...}

The force is stored as Python dictionary associating a complex value in SI
units to the name of the influenced degree of freedom.
In other words, in the example code above, the :math:`x`-component of the force
vector has magnitude 23941 Newton at :math:`t =0`, while the
:math:`y`-component of the force vector is negligible at all time.

For radiation problems, the result object also contain ``added_mass`` and
``radiation_damping`` attributes, with the same shape of a Python dictionary.

It the solver was called with ``keep_details=True``, the result object also
contains the potential and pressure fields on each face of the mesh of the hull::

  print(result.potential)
  # [-1.72534485e-03+0.14128629j -3.98932611e-03+0.33387497j
  #  -6.54135830e-03+0.54208628j ... -2.09853806e+00-0.56106653j
  #  -2.18441640e+00-0.58402701j -2.22777755e+00-0.59562008j]

  print(result.pressure)
  # [-1.72534485e-03+0.14128629j -3.98932611e-03+0.33387497j
  #  -6.54135830e-03+0.54208628j ... -2.09853806e+00-0.56106653j
  #  -2.18441640e+00-0.58402701j -2.22777755e+00-0.59562008j]

These magnitudes are stored in an one-dimensionnal array as long as the number
of faces of the mesh, and stored in the same order as the faces in the ``Mesh``
object. In other words, ``result.pressure[3]`` contains the pressure on the
face of center ``body.mesh.faces_centers[3]``.

Recall that the potential and the pressure are related by :math:`p = j \rho
\omega \Phi`, where :math:`\rho` is the fluid density and :math:`\omega` is the
angular frequency.

The potential, the pressure and the velocity in the rest of the fluid can be
computed in post-processing as described in :doc:`post_pro`.

When using the indirect boundary integral equation (by default), the result
object with details also contains the distribution of sources :math:`\sigma` on
the hull, under the same form as the potential above::

  print(result.sources)
  # [  0.0281344 -0.35719578j   0.06715056-1.34127138j
  #    0.10891061-2.26921669j ... -13.58069557+2.13219904j
  #  -14.13645749+2.21945488j -14.41706935+2.26351156j]


Building a dataset from LinearPotentialFlowResult
-------------------------------------------------

If you have a list of :code:`LinearPotentialFlowResult`, you can assemble
them in a xarray dataset for a more convenient post-processing. Use the
following syntax::

   from capytaine import assemble_dataset
   dataset = assemble_dataset(list_of_results)

If you gave a test matrix to the :code:`BEMSolver.fill_dataset` method, the
output will directly be an xarray dataset.

Both :code:`assemble_dataset` and :code:`fill_dataset` accept some optional keyword
arguments to store more information in the dataset:

- :code:`wavenumber` (default: :code:`False`): add the wavenumber of the
  incoming waves in the dataset.
- :code:`wavelength` (default: :code:`False`): add the wavelength of the
  incoming waves in the dataset.
- :code:`mesh` (default: :code:`False`): add some information about the mesh in
  the dataset (number of faces, quadrature method).
- :code:`hydrostatics` (default: :code:`True`): if hydrostatics data are
  available in the :code:`FloatingBody`, they are added to the dataset.

.. note:: The code does its best to keep the degrees of freedom in the same
          order as they have been provided by the user, but there is no
          guarantee that this will always be the case.
          Nonetheless, in all cases the labels will always match the data.
          So selecting a value by the name of the dof will always return the right one::

              data.sel(radiating_dof="Heave", influenced_dof="Heave")

          You can also manually reorder the dofs with the following syntax::

              sorted_dofs = ["Surge", "Sway", "Heave", "Roll", "Pitch", "Yaw"]
              print(data.sel(radiating_dof=sorted_dofs, influenced_dof=sorted_dofs))

.. note:: Datasets created with :code:`assemble_dataset` only include data on
          cases with a free surface.
          Cases without a free surface (:code:`free_surface=inf`) are ignored.

Building a dataset from Bemio
-----------------------------

An xarray dataset can also be created from data structures generated using the `Bemio
<https://wec-sim.github.io/bemio/>`_ package, which reads hydrodynamic output data
from NEMOH, WAMIT, and AQWA. This allows for Capytaine post-processing of hydrodynamic
data generated from other BEM codes.

Bemio does not come packaged with Capytaine and needs to to be installed independently.
Note that `the base repository of Bemio <https://github.com/WEC-Sim/bemio/>`_ has been
archived and is only compatible with Python 2.7.x, so using a Python 3 compatible fork is
recommended, available `here <https://github.com/michaelcdevin/bemio>`_ or installed with::

  pip install git+https://github.com/michaelcdevin/bemio.git

To build the xarray dataset using Capytaine, the output files from the BEM program in
question must be read into a Bemio :code:`data_structures.ben.HydrodynamicData` class, which is
then called by `assemble_dataset`. For example, to create an xarray dataset from a WAMIT
:code:`.out` file::

  from bemio.io.wamit import read as read_wamit
  import capytaine as cpt
  bemio_data = read_wamit("myfile.out")
  my_dataset = cpt.assemble_dataset(bemio_data, hydrostatics=False)

.. warning:: The created dataset will only contain quantities that can be directly calculated
             from the values given in the original dataset. Because of this, there may be minor
             differences between the variable names in an xarray dataset build with Bemio and one created
             using :code:`LinearPotentialFlowResult`, even though the format will be identical. For
             example, WAMIT :code:`.out` files do not contain the radii of gyration needed to calculate
             the moments of inertia, so the `my_dataset['inertia_matrix']` variable would not be included
             in the above example since the rigid body mass matrix cannot be calculated.

Saving the dataset as NetCDF file
---------------------------------

The xarray dataset produced by :func:`assemble_dataset <capytaine.results.assemble_dataset>` (or :meth:`fill_dataset <capytaine.bem.solver.BEMSolver.fill_dataset>`) has a structure close to the NetCDF file format and can easily be saved to this format::

	dataset.to_netcdf("path/to/dataset.nc")

See the `documentation of xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/io.html>`_ for details and options.

There are however a couple of issues you should be aware of:


Complex numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The netCDF standard does not handle complex numbers.
As a workaround, the complex-valued array can be saved as a bigger real-valued array with the help of the :mod:`capytaine.io.xarray` module::

    from capytaine.io.xarray import separate_complex_values
    separate_complex_values(dataset).to_netcdf("path/to/dataset.nc")

The dataset can then be reloaded by::

    import xarray as xr
    from capytaine.io.xarray import merge_complex_values
    dataset = merge_complex_values(xr.open_dataset("path/to/dataset.nc"))


String format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is an issue with the handling of strings in xarray.
It affects the coordinates with strings as labels such as :code:`radiating_dof` and :code:`influenced_dof`.
They can be stored in xarray either as NetCDF string objects, which can be written in a NetCDF file, or as Python strings stored as generic Python objects, which cannot be written in a NetCDF file.
The issue is that the xarray library sometimes changes from one to the other without warnings.
It leads to the error :code:`ValueError: unsupported dtype for netCDF4 variable: object` when trying to export a dataset.

This can be fixed by explicitly converting the strings to the right format when exporting the dataset::

    separate_complex_values(dataset).to_netcdf(
      "dataset.nc",
      encoding={'radiating_dof': {'dtype': 'U'},
                'influenced_dof': {'dtype': 'U'}}
    )

See also `this Github issue <https://github.com/capytaine/capytaine/issues/2>`_.


Saving the rotation center of rigid bodies
-----------------------------------------

Some software downstream of Capytaine, such as `BEMRosetta <https://github.com/BEMRosetta/BEMRosetta>`_, require the NetCDF file to store the rotation center of each body.
While this is not yet done automatically by Capytaine, it can be added to the dataset manually as in the following example, which is an extension of the :doc:`quickstart` example::

  import numpy as np
  import xarray as xr
  import capytaine as cpt

  body_1 = cpt.FloatingBody(
              mesh=cpt.mesh_sphere(center=(0, 0, 0)),
              dofs=cpt.rigid_body_dofs(rotation_center=(0, 0, 0)),
              center_of_mass=(0, 0, 0),
              name="my_sphere",
          )
  body_1.inertia_matrix = body_1.compute_rigid_body_inertia()
  body_1.hydrostatic_stiffness = body_1.immersed_part().compute_hydrostatic_stiffness()
  # If you have several rigid bodies, copy the code above to define "body_2", "body_3", etc.

  list_of_bodies = [body_1]  # Replace "[body_1]" by "[body_1, body_2, body_3]" for multibody problem.

  all_bodies = cpt.FloatingBody.join_bodies(*list_of_bodies).immersed_part()

  # Set up parameters
  test_matrix = xr.Dataset({
          "omega": np.linspace(0.1, 2.0, 20),  # Can also specify "period", "wavelength" or "wavenumber"
          "wave_direction": np.linspace(0, np.pi, 3),
          "radiating_dof": list(all_bodies.dofs),
          })

  # Do the resolution
  solver = cpt.BEMSolver()
  dataset = solver.fill_dataset(test_matrix, all_bodies)

  dataset.coords["rigid_body_component"] = [body.name for body in list_of_bodies]
  dataset["rotation_center"] = (["rigid_body_component", "point_coordinates"], [body.rotation_center for body in list_of_bodies])
  dataset["center_of_mass"] = (["rigid_body_component", "point_coordinates"], [body.center_of_mass for body in list_of_bodies])

  # Export to NetCDF file
  from capytaine.io.xarray import separate_complex_values
  separate_complex_values(dataset).to_netcdf("dataset.nc",
                                             encoding={'radiating_dof': {'dtype': 'U'},
                                                       'influenced_dof': {'dtype': 'U'}})

The support for this in Capytaine should be improved in the future.

Exporting to Excel
------------------

The example below uses the ``openpyxl`` library (that can be installed with ``pip install openpyxl``) to export a dataset to Excel format::

    dataset[["added_mass", "radiation_damping"]].to_dataframe().to_excel("radiation_data.xlsx")

    from capytaine.io.xarray import separate_complex_values
    separate_complex_values(dataset[["Froude_Krylov_force", "diffraction_force"]]).to_dataframe().to_excel("diffraction_data.xlsx")

For convenience, the radiation and diffraction data have been stored in separate files.
Since this export method poorly supports complex number, the :func:`separate_complex_values <capytaine.io.xarray.separate_complex_values>` has been used to transform them to a pair of real numbers, as discussed for NetCDF export above.


Saving the hydrostatics data of rigid body(ies) in Nemoh's format
-----------------------------------------------------------------

For a rigid body, or a set of several rigid bodies, the following information can be saved as written by Nemoh's and read by BEMIO to produce :code:`.h5` files for WEC-Sim:

- Hydrostatic stiffness matrix,
- Centre of gravity,
- Centre of buoyancy,
- Displacement volume

They are stored in two files (:code:`Hydrostatics.dat` and :code:`KH.dat`) for each body, using the following syntax::

    from capytaine.io.legacy import export_hydrostatics
    export_hydrostatics("directory_to_save_hydrostatics_data", body)

for a single rigid body or, e.g.,::

    from capytaine.io.legacy import export_hydrostatics
    export_hydrostatics("directory_to_save_hydrostatics_data", [body_1, body_2, body_3])

for several rigid bodies.

In order to use this function, please ensure that the body's centre of gravity has been defined correctly and the following methods have been called on the :code:`FloatingBody` object before passing it to :func:`export_hydrostatics <capytaine.io.legacy.export_hydrostatics>`::

  body.add_all_rigid_body_dofs()
  body.inertia_matrix = body.compute_rigid_body_inertia()
  body.hydrostatic_stiffness = body.compute_hydrostatic_stiffness()


Saving the data as legacy Tecplot files
---------------------------------------

.. warning:: This feature is experimental.

The following code will write files named :code:`RadiationCoefficients.tec` and :code:`ExcitationForce.tec` in a format matching the one of Nemoh 2.0::

	from capytaine.io.legacy import write_dataset_as_tecplot_files
	write_dataset_as_tecplot_files("path/to/directory", dataset)
