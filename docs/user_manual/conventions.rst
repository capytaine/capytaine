Conventions and differences to other codes
==========================================

.. note::
    To be expanded.

Unlike most other codes, angles (such as the incoming wave direction) are given in radians in Capytaine.

With respect to WAMIT
---------------------

In Capytaine, the complex-valued amplitudes (phasors) are defined with the convention :math:`x(t) = \Re ( X e^{-i \omega t})`.
It is unlike WAMIT in which the convention :math:`x(t) = \Re ( X e^{+ i \omega t})` is used.

With respect to Nemoh and Aquadyn
---------------------------------

Capytaine mostly follows the same conventions as Nemoh, which are also the same as in Aquadyn.
The main exception is the phase angle of the excitation force in Nemoh and Capytaine is the opposite of the one in Aquadyn.
