Conventions and differences to other codes
==========================================

.. note::
    To be expanded.

* The complex-valued amplitudes (phasors) are defined with the convention :math:`x(t) = \Re ( X e^{-i \omega t})`.
  It is similar to Nemoh and unlike WAMIT in which the convention :math:`x(t) = \Re ( X e^{+ i \omega t})` is used.

* Unlike most other codes, angles (such as the incoming wave direction) are given in radians.
