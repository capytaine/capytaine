-------------------------------
New in version 1.2 (2020-04-24)
-------------------------------

* Experimental implementation of higher order quadratures for the integration of
  the Green function on the mesh. Default behavior is still the first order
  integration as in Nemoh.

* Add method :code:`FloatingBody.animate` to quickly visualize the motion of a body
  and add method :code:`Animation.embed_in_notebook` to embed animations in Jupyter
  notebooks.

* Keep the order of the dofs in `xarray`'s Datasets.
  This patch uses the CategoricalIndex feature of `xarray` which was buggy
  before version 0.15.1 of `xarray`. Thus this minimal version is now required.

* Add missing Kochin function for the diffraction.
  (See `Github issue #22 <https://github.com/mancellin/capytaine/issues/22>`_.)
  In previous version the variable named :code:`kochin` in the dataset was only the
  Kochin function for the radiated waves. A new variable names
  :code:`kochin_diffraction` has been added. The existing variable :code:`kochin` has not
  been renamed, for backward compatibility, but might be in a future release of
  Capytaine.

* Improvement of caching to limit RAM usage for large problems.

* Make optional the dependancy to graphical packages (`matplotlib` and `vtk`).
  They were causing issues to some users.

* :code:`problems_and_results.py` has been rewritten to be slightly more readable and
  remove the dependancy to `attrs`.

-------------------------------
New in version 1.1 (2019-09-24)
-------------------------------

Major changes
-------------

* Refactoring of the implementation of the solver.
  The new implementation separates the solver itself from the evaluation of the
  Green function and the matrix building engine.
  This more modular structure allows user to choose separately the Green
  function and the matrix engine that they want to use.

  The former API (:code:`Nemoh()` object) has been kept for backward compatibility.
  In most cases, replacing :code:`Nemoh()` by :code:`BEMSolver()` is sufficient
  to migrate to the new structure.

  See :doc:`user_manual/resolution` for the full documentation of the new structure
  and :doc:`user_manual/cookbook` for examples.


* Add Xie's variant of Delhommeau's Green function
  :class:`~capytaine.green_functions.delhommeau.XieDelhommeau` [X18]_.


* The option `cache_rankine_matrices` has been removed. It was impeding the
  performance and modularity of the code for a very low gain. It might be
  reimplemented in a future version if there is really a need for it.

Minor changes
-------------

* Minor performance improvements.

* Fix Github issue #18.

* Improve test suite.

  direction.

-------------------------------

Major changes
-------------

  matrices and block circulant matrices.
  Refactoring of the block diagonalization of block circulant matrices through
  FFT.

* Low rank approximation of the matrices with Adaptive Cross Approximation for
  the use of hierarchical matrices.

* Option to solve the linear system with GMRES instead of a direct solver.

* Refactoring of the 3D animation module for animation of the body motions,
  animated colormap of the pressure, free-surface elevation and export as a
  video. See cookbook for an example of the new API.

Minor changes
-------------

General
~~~~~~~

* Reorganization of the :code:`pytest` directory.

* Add an experimental :code:`capytaine.tools.rao` module to compute Response Amplitude
  Operators.

* Various bug fixes and improvements of the documentation.

Solver
~~~~~~

* More options to set the behavior of the solver at run time :code:`Nemoh` (use
  of symmetries, use of caching, choice of the linear solver, ...).
  See its docstring for details.

* Change of default behavior: the solver stores the details in the :code:`Result`
  container when using :code:`solve`, not when using :code:`solve_all` or
  :code:`fill_dataset`.

* The water density can be specified in the test matrix when using
  :code:`fill_dataset`.

* Function :code:`kochin_dataset` to build a xarray of Kochin function.

* Add the option :code:`chunk_size` to the computation of the free surface
  elevation in order to limit the RAM consumption.

* Minor refactoring of the solver and the computation of the Green function.

Meshes and bodies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* CollectionOfMeshes is not a subclass of Tuple anymore.

* New method :code:`assemble_regular_array` to build an array of identical bodies.

* Harmonize naming of functions that are not in-place: :code:`symmetrize -> symmetrized`, :code:`merge -> merged`

* Refactoring of the internals of the mesh clipper. New :code:`clip` and :code:`clipped` methods for meshes and bodies.
  When a body is clipped with :code:`clip` or :code:`keep_immersed_part`, the dofs are updated.

* Change naming of dof when bodies are joined: :code:`body_name__dof_name` instead of :code:`body_name_dof_name`.

* The combination of bodies with :code:`+` is associative with respect to the
  names of the dofs.

* Minor improvements of meshes and bodies :code:`repr`.

* Integration of a refactored subset of Meshmagick into Capytaine as the :code:`mesh` submodule.
  Meshmagick is not a dependancy any more.

* Reorganization of the submodules:

::

  capytaine.mesh_collection                  -> capytaine.mesh.meshes_collection
  capytaine.symmetries                       -> capytaine.mesh.symmetries
  capytaine.cli                              -> capytaine.ui.cli
  capytaine.tools.vtk                        -> capytaine.ui.vtk
  capytaine.tools.mpl_free_surface_animation -> capytaine.ui.mpl_free_surface_animation
  capytaine.tools.import_export              -> capytaine.io.legacy
  capytaine.tools.bemio                      -> capytaine.io.bemio
  meshmagick.mmio                            -> capytaine.io.mesh_loaders and capytaine.io.mesh_writers

Minor changes
-------------

Solver
~~~~~~

* Reorganization of the internals of the solver :code:`Nemoh.py` and :code:`NemohCore`.
  The initialization options :code:`keep_matrices` and :code:`max_stored_exponential_decompositions` have been removed.
  The former has been replaced by a :code:`matrix_cache_size` optional argument (default value: 1).

* Support of :math:`\omega=0` and :math:`\omega=\infty` in the infinite depth case.

* The wavenumber is not computed in Fortran anymore.

Outputs
~~~~~~~

* Some body properties are stored in xarray dataset if they are available.
  New functions :code:`add_wavenumber_coords` and :code:`kochin_data_array` allow the storage of wavenumbers and Kochin function in the dataset.

* New functions :code:`separate_complex_values` and :code:`merge_complex_values`
  in :code:`capytaine.io.xarray` to better handle complex values when saving
  datasets.

* New function :code:`problems_from_dataset` to generate a list of problems from the coordinates of
  a xarray dataset.
  New method :code:`fill_dataset` in :code:`capytaine.Nemoh.Nemoh` using the above.

* New function :code:`write_dataset_as_tecplot_files()` in :code:`capytaine.tools` for legacy Tecplot output.

Meshes
~~~~~~

* Refactoring of the transformation methods (:code:`translate`, :code:`rotate`, :code:`mirror`, ...).

  * They are still in place by default, although they now return a reference to the modified object.
  * They can return a new object by passing the argument :code:`inplace=False` or by using the
    variants :code:`translated`, :code:`rotated`, :code:`mirrored`.
  * :code:`rotate` and :code:`rotated` requires an :code:`Axis` object as argument. Old behavior
    can be found in :code:`rotate_angles` and :code:`rotated_angles`.
  * :code:`get_immersed_part` is inplace by default. Use :code:`inplace=False` to return a new
    object.

* :code:`add_rotation_dof` now requires an Axis object.

* New method :code:`tree_view()` for meshes to display the structure of hierarchical collections of meshes.

* :code:`CollectionOfMeshes` and :code:`SymmetricBodies` are now subclasses from :code:`tuple`.
  New methods :code:`join_meshes` to merge several symmetric bodies with the same symmetries as a
  single symmetric body.

* Various improvements in :code:`geometric_bodies` submodule, especially for :code:`Rectangle` and :code:`RectangularParallelepiped`.
  They can now be generated with reflections symmetries instead of translation symmetries.
  New :code:`VerticalCylinder` class.

* Refactored mesh objects can be checked for equality and are hashable.
  The method is experimental and can be improved.
