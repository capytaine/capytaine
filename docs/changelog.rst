Changelog
=========

* Fix major bug in impedance matrix and RAO computation: the sign of the
  dissipation matrix was wrong in previous versions (:issue:`102` and
  :pull:`140`).

* Method :code:`show_matplotlib` can now colour mesh faces based on a
  specified scalar field (e.g. pressure) (:pull:`122`).

* Add new parallelization using the `joblib <https://joblib.readthedocs.io>`_ library as a new optional dependency.
  The optional keyword-argument :code:`n_jobs` in the :meth:`~capytaine.bem.solver.BEMSolver.solve_all` and :meth:`~capytaine.bem.solver.BEMSolver.fill_dataset` controls the number of processes running in parallel (:pull:`136`).

* A new example using Haskind's relation has been added to the cookbook (:pull:`129`).

* New implementation of the mesh importer for `hst` files (:pull:`90`)

* Add :code:`position_impedance` and :code:`velocity_impedance` functions to the :code:`post_pro` module to specify which impedance is requested (:pull:`142`)

* Add a warning if the user provides a :code:`wave_direction` that is not in the range [-2π, 2π].

* Wave directions in :code:`Nemoh.cal` are interpreted as degrees as they should be (and then converted to radians to be handled by the rest of the code).

* Raises an error when a body with an empty mesh is given to :code:`LinearPotentialFlowProblem` (:issue:`128`).

* The functions :code:`problems_from_dataset` and :code:`fill_dataset` accept a body alone as input.
  That is, one can use :code:`fill_dataset(test_matrix, body)` and not only :code:`fill_dataset(test_matrix, [body])` (pull:`144`).

* Add method to compute some of the hydrostatic parameters such as volume, buoyancy center, wet surface area, hydrostatic stiffness, inertia matrix etc.
  :code:`compute_hydrostatics` method is created to return all hydrostatic parameters similar to :code:`meshmagick.hydrostatics.compute_hydrostatics` (:pull:`106`).

-------------------------------
New in version 1.3 (2021-10-07)
-------------------------------

Major changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The mesh are always "healed" when a new :code:`FloatingBody` is initialised
  (i.e. unused vertices are removed, degenerate triangles are removed, etc.).
  See for instance :issue:`46`.

* Implementation of symmetries for :code:`HorizontalCylinder` has changed.
  The cylinder is now a reflection of two halves containing translational
  repetition of half rings, instead of a translational repetition of symmetric
  ring. By default, only reflection symmetry is used. (:pull:`91`)
  The use of symmetries can be controlled with :code:`translation_symmetry` and
  :code:`reflection_symmetry` optional keyword arguments.
  The :code:`clever` keyword argument is deprecated for :code:`HorizontalCylinder`
  and should be replaced by the new more explicit keyword arguments above.


New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add method :code:`FloatingBody.from_meshio` to import `meshio <https://pypi.org/project/meshio/>`_ and `pygmsh <https://pypi.org/project/pygmsh/>`_ mesh objects (:pull:`62`)

* Add method :code:`FloatingBody.assemble_arbitrary_array` to make an array of bodies with arbitrary layout (:pull:`71`).

* Break out impedance from RAO to separate function (:issue:`61` and :pull:`63`).

* Method `problems_from_dataset` can now use a list of gravitational acceleration `g` values in the test matrix (:pull:`86`).

* Add example in cookbook for computing hydrostatics and mass properties with Meshmagick 2 (:pull:`70`).

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fix bug in free surface elevation computation when the number of faces in the free surface mesh is not a multiple of the chunk size, that is by default a multiple of 50 (:pull:`82`).

* The function :code:`assemble_dataset` did not support well the problems without a free surface. In the new version, such problems are explicitly ignored and a warning message is displayed. (:issue:`88` and :pull:`89`).

* Fix bug in some of the mesh readers/writers when using pathlib path objects (:pull:`87`).

* Function :code:`load_GDF` has been rewritten to accept any GDF file format (:pull:`97`).

Internal and development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Easier installation of optional dependencies via :code:`pip install -e .[extra]` and :code:`pip install -e .[develop]` (:pull:`96`).

* Use pytest skipif to skip tests if optional dependencies are not installed (:pull:`68`).

---------------------------------
New in version 1.2.1 (2021-04-14)
---------------------------------

* Minor bug fixes,
  including `issue #37 <https://github.com/mancellin/capytaine/issues/37>`_
  and `issue #56 <https://github.com/mancellin/capytaine/issues/56>`_ (thanks to Ryan Coe).

* Add a warning when a panel is on the free surface
  (see `#29 <https://github.com/mancellin/capytaine/issues/29>`_
  and `#50 <https://github.com/mancellin/capytaine/issues/50>`_)

-------------------------------
New in version 1.2 (2020-04-24)
-------------------------------

* Experimental implementation of higher order quadratures for the integration of
  the Green function on the mesh. Default behavior is still the first order
  integration as in Nemoh.

* Add method :code:`FloatingBody.animate` to quickly visualize the motion of a body
  and add method :code:`Animation.embed_in_notebook` to embed animations in Jupyter
  notebooks.

* Keep the order of the dofs in `xarray`'s Datasets.
  This patch uses the CategoricalIndex feature of `xarray` which was buggy
  before version 0.15.1 of `xarray`. Thus this minimal version is now required.

* Add missing Kochin function for the diffraction.
  (See `Github issue #22 <https://github.com/mancellin/capytaine/issues/22>`_.)
  In previous version the variable named :code:`kochin` in the dataset was only the
  Kochin function for the radiated waves. A new variable names
  :code:`kochin_diffraction` has been added. The existing variable :code:`kochin` has not
  been renamed, for backward compatibility, but might be in a future release of
  Capytaine.

* Improvement of caching to limit RAM usage for large problems.

* Make optional the dependency to graphical packages (`matplotlib` and `vtk`).
  They were causing issues to some users.

* :code:`problems_and_results.py` has been rewritten to be slightly more readable and
  remove the dependency to `attrs`.

-------------------------------
New in version 1.1 (2019-09-24)
-------------------------------

Major changes
-------------

* Refactoring of the implementation of the solver.
  The new implementation separates the solver itself from the evaluation of the
  Green function and the matrix building engine.
  This more modular structure allows user to choose separately the Green
  function and the matrix engine that they want to use.

  The former API (:code:`Nemoh()` object) has been kept for backward compatibility.
  In most cases, replacing :code:`Nemoh()` by :code:`BEMSolver()` is sufficient
  to migrate to the new structure.

  See :doc:`user_manual/resolution` for the full documentation of the new structure
  and :doc:`user_manual/cookbook` for examples.


* Add Xie's variant of Delhommeau's Green function
  :class:`~capytaine.green_functions.delhommeau.XieDelhommeau` [X18]_.


* The option `cache_rankine_matrices` has been removed. It was impeding the
  performance and modularity of the code for a very low gain. It might be
  reimplemented in a future version if there is really a need for it.

Minor changes
-------------

* Minor performance improvements.

* Fix Github issue #18.

* Improve test suite.

~~~~~~

* More options to set the behavior of the solver at run time :code:`Nemoh` (use
  of symmetries, use of caching, choice of the linear solver, ...).
  See its docstring for details.

* Change of default behavior: the solver stores the details in the :code:`Result`
  container when using :code:`solve`, not when using :code:`solve_all` or
  :code:`fill_dataset`.

* The water density can be specified in the test matrix when using
  :code:`fill_dataset`.

* Function :code:`kochin_dataset` to build a xarray of Kochin function.

* Add the option :code:`chunk_size` to the computation of the free surface
  elevation in order to limit the RAM consumption.

* The combination of bodies with :code:`+` is associative with respect to the
  names of the dofs.

* Minor improvements of meshes and bodies :code:`repr`.

Minor changes
-------------

Solver
~~~~~~

* Reorganization of the internals of the solver :code:`Nemoh.py` and :code:`NemohCore`.
  The initialization options :code:`keep_matrices` and :code:`max_stored_exponential_decompositions` have been removed.
  The former has been replaced by a :code:`matrix_cache_size` optional argument (default value: 1).

* Support of :math:`\omega=0` and :math:`\omega=\infty` in the infinite depth case.

* The wavenumber is not computed in Fortran anymore.

Outputs
~~~~~~~

* Some body properties are stored in xarray dataset if they are available.
  New functions :code:`add_wavenumber_coords` and :code:`kochin_data_array` allow the storage of wavenumbers and Kochin function in the dataset.

  in :code:`capytaine.io.xarray` to better handle complex values when saving
  datasets.

* New function :code:`problems_from_dataset` to generate a list of problems from the coordinates of
  a xarray dataset.
  New method :code:`fill_dataset` in :code:`capytaine.Nemoh.Nemoh` using the above.

Meshes
~~~~~~

* Refactoring of the transformation methods (:code:`translate`, :code:`rotate`, :code:`mirror`, ...).

  * They are still in place by default, although they now return a reference to the modified object.
  * They can return a new object by passing the argument :code:`inplace=False` or by using the
    variants :code:`translated`, :code:`rotated`, :code:`mirrored`.
  * :code:`rotate` and :code:`rotated` requires an :code:`Axis` object as argument. Old behavior
    can be found in :code:`rotate_angles` and :code:`rotated_angles`.
  * :code:`get_immersed_part` is inplace by default. Use :code:`inplace=False` to return a new
    object.

* :code:`add_rotation_dof` now requires an Axis object.

* New method :code:`tree_view()` for meshes to display the structure of hierarchical collections of meshes.

* :code:`CollectionOfMeshes` and :code:`SymmetricBodies` are now subclasses from :code:`tuple`.
  New methods :code:`join_meshes` to merge several symmetric bodies with the same symmetries as a
  single symmetric body.

* Various improvements in :code:`geometric_bodies` submodule, especially for :code:`Rectangle` and :code:`RectangularParallelepiped`.
  They can now be generated with reflections symmetries instead of translation symmetries.
