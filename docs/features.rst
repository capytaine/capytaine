Capytaine is based on

* Nemoh_'s Fortran core routines for the computation of the Green function,
* meshmagick_ for the manipulation of meshes,
* and various tools from the `Python scientific ecosystem`_.

.. _Nemoh: https://lheea.ec-nantes.fr/logiciels-et-brevets/nemoh-presentation-192863.kjsp
.. _meshmagick: https://github.com/LHEEA/meshmagick
.. _`Python scientific ecosystem`: https://scipy.org/

For users, it can be seen as a Python 3.7 (or higher) interface to Nemoh.
Since most of the code has been rewritten, it can be used by developers as a
more concise and better documented version of Nemoh.

Below some features of the latest version (version |version|) of Capytaine are listed.

Main features
-------------

* Computation of the added masses, radiation dampings, diffraction forces and Froude-Krylov forces for rigid bodies or for bodies with any arbitrary degrees of freedom.
* Python object oriented API.
* OpenMP parallelization.
* Direct or iterative linear system solver.
* Various input mesh formats supported via meshmagick_.
* Output in legacy Nemoh Tecplot format or NetCDF format.
* Computation of the free surface elevation and the Kochin function.
* 3D animations of the body motion and the free surface elevation.
* A cleaner code with unit tests, meaningful variable names, more comments, no Fortran 77, no global variables and no error message in French.
* Single or double precision floating-point numbers.
* Possibility to plug-in other implementations of the Green function
* Binaries distributed via `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_.

Experimental features
---------------------

* Computation of the hydrostatic stiffness and rigid body inertia. Non-neutrally buoyant bodies are partially supported.
* Computation of the impedance matrix and the Response Amplitude Operators (RAO).
* Input via legacy ``Nemoh.cal`` files.
* Hierarchical matrices with low-rank blocks for faster simulations.
* Toeplitz matrices for faster simulations for floating bodies with local symmetries or for regular arrays of identical floating bodies.
* Higher order quadratures for more precise integration of the Green function.
